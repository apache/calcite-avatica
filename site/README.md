# Apache Calcite Avatica site

This directory contains the code for the
[Avatica web site](https://calcite.apache.org/avatica),
a sub-directory of the
[Apache Calcite web site](https://calcite.apache.org).

You can build the site manually using your environment or use the docker compose file.

The site is automatically built and published following the process outlined in the [Calcite repository](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/master/site/README.md).

# Previewing the website locally

## Building website on a host system

### Setup your environment

Similar to the instructions to
[set up the Calcite web site](https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica/blob/master/site/README.md).

Site generation currently works best with ruby-2.7.4.

1. `cd site`
2. `git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/calcite-site.git target`.
The site will be generated to target/avatica, so it will be ready for commit.
3. `sudo apt-get install rubygems ruby2.7-dev zlib1g-dev` (linux)
4. `sudo gem install bundler`
5. Add avatica-go content: `./add-avatica-go-docs.sh`
6. `bundle install`

### Build javadoc

1. `cd $avatica_project_directory`
2. `./gradlew javadocAggregate # the result is placed to build/docs/javadocAggregate`

### Running website locally

Before opening a pull request, you can preview your contributions by
running from within the directory:

1. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Open [http://localhost:4000/avatica/](http://localhost:4000/avatica/) (note the trailing slash)

### Building the website

1. `bundle exec jekyll build`
2. The result is produced to `target/avatica`

## Building website with Docker

### Setup your environment

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Install [docker compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#installing-compose-v2)

### Build site
1. `cd site`
2. `docker compose run build-site`

### Generate javadoc
1. `cd site`
2. `docker compose run generate-javadoc`

### Running development mode locally
You can preview your work while working on the site.

1. `cd site`
2. `docker compose run --service-ports dev`

The web server will be started on [http://localhost:4000/avatica/](http://localhost:4000/avatica/) (note the trailing slash)

As you make changes to the site, the site will automatically rebuild.
