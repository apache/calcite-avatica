Apache Calcite Avatica 1.9.0 includes various improvements to make it
more robust and secure, while maintaining API and protocol
compatibility with previous versions.

We now [include non-shaded and shaded artifacts](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1224),
to make it easier to embed Avatica in your application.

There are improvements to the JDBC API, adding support for
[canceling statements](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1301),
and improving
[type conversions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1408)
and
[metadata](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1410).

The transport is upgraded to use
[protobuf-3.1.0](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1355)
(previously 3.0 beta); we have also
[upgraded Jetty](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-1464).
