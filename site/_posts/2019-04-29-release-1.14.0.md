Apache Calcite Avatica 1.14.0 includes around 13
[bug fixes and new features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history.html#v1-14-0).

A number of dependencies were upgraded for this release, with Jetty being
a noteworthy upgrade due to the old version having a medium severity vulnerability.
Avatica users are encouraged to upgrade to 1.14.0 where practical.
